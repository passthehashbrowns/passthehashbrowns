# About Me
I'm a red teamer/penetration tester by craft. I got my start in AD penetration testing, did a brief stint as a red teamer, and now I do all manners of consulting work.

This is where I post the random stuff that I research. None of it is particularly good but hopefully some of it is useful. I mainly focus on Windows/Active Directory.
